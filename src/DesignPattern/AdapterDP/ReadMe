#Adapter Design Pattern:

#Definition:
It is a structural design pattern and is also known as the Wrapper Design Pattern.
This design pattern acts as a bridge between two different interfaces. It can convert the interface of a
class, to make it compatible with a client who is expecting a different interface, without changing the
source code of the class.

When you need to make an interface of one class compatible with another class.
Example -> Payment Gateway Integration: Adapt various payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe, Square)
to a common interface for processing transactions.
